## Docker Swarm

This repo was created with study intentions, this will be my workshop, in my docker/docker-swarm learning.
In here you will find some Ansible, Terraform, Docker, Docker-Swarm, Nginx, N8N and Apache Cloudstack.

### Pre-requisites

You will need to create a cluster using virtual machines and so if you have a cloud account you can use that. Or you could also create an virtual machines environment using virtualbox for example. Anyways you will need:

* At least 3 instances (1 Master and 2 workers)
* A guest network on Apache Cloudstack
* Firewall Rules
* Port forwarding
* Workstation running linux or windows with wsl
